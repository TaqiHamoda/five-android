Blokada 5 is the well known open source mobile ad blocker and privacy app.

## Difference to Blokada 6

There is also Blokada 6 with cloud adblocking (as opposed to on-device adblocking of Blokada 5). It works better for most users, but requires a subscription. [Click here to open Google Play Store](https://go.blokada.org/play_cloud).

Both editions are being developed independently. See our main Github page for the source code.
